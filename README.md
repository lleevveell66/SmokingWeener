SmokingWeener v0.2 by Raymond Spangle (https://github.com/lleevveell66)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
This python script is meant to help ween me off of cigarettes.  It will
eventually "learn" my current habits, and begin to adjust to me.  For
now, it's running on a Raspberry Pi Zero WH with a Velleman Active
Buzzer Module (VMA319) on pins 9 (GND) and 11 (GPIO 17) and an NTE
Electronics SPST Round Panel Mount Push Button (54-700-B) on pins
12 (GPIO 18) and 14 (GND).  Note that the Buzzer module middle pin is
not used.  GND goes to the pin labeled "-" and GPIO 17 goes to the pin
labeled "S".
